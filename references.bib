abstract = {Propositional satisfiability solving (SAT) has been one of the most successful automated reasoning methods in the last decade in computer science by solving a wide range of both industrial and academic problems. One of the most widely used constraint during the process of translating a practical problem into a SAT instance is the at-most-one (AMO) constraint. Many studies on SAT encodings of the AMO constraint have been reported in the literature, however thorough comparisons of these encodings are largely missing. This paper not only provide such comparisons, but also discusses the similarity of the SAT encodings of the AMO constraint and SAT encodings of more general CSPs. More specifically, the paper empirically evaluates the most well-known AMO encodings on three state-of-the-art SAT solvers of a number of benchmarks and provides some guidelines for efficient SAT encodings of the AMO constraint leading.},

Specifically, we show that there are functions with πk-formula of size n for which every σk-formula has size exp ω(n1/(k−1)). A similar lower bound applies to concrete functions such as transitive closure and clique. We also show that any function with a formula of size n (and any depth) has a σk-formula of size exp o(n1/(k−1)). Thus our hierarchy theorem is the best possible.},
